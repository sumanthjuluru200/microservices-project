🏦 Banking Microservices Project
This is a Java-based Banking Microservices Application built using Spring Boot, designed to simulate real-world banking operations such as account management, loan processing, and credit card services. The architecture follows microservices principles, ensuring each domain (Accounts, Loans, Cards) is independently deployable, scalable, and maintainable.

🚀 Tech Stack
Java 17+

Spring Boot

Spring Data JPA

Spring Cloud (Config, Gateway, Eureka, OpenFeign)

📦 Microservices Overview
Service	Description
accounts	Manages customer bank accounts (create, view, update)
loans	Handles personal/education/home loans with basic eligibility and tracking
cards	Manages credit cards – issue, usage tracking, and credit limits
config-server	Centralized configuration management using Spring Cloud Config
eureka-server	Service registry for all microservices
api-gateway	Unified API entry point with routing, filtering, and security (if added)

🧩 Features
RESTful APIs for each microservice

Centralized configuration and discovery

Error handling with custom exceptions

DTO mapping and service-layer abstraction

Clean code architecture with modular design

Secure endpoints (optionally with Spring Security & JWT)

📚 Future Enhancements (Optional)
